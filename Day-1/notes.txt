Terminology in machine learning


Problem is to Predict the Salary of the employee with his experience

1.Get the data related to the problem
	past Salary of employee   experience




2. Pre-processing(manipulate,clean)
	Is there is any missing?
	is there any invalid values?
	is the data has correct format object/string

i want predict person has cancer or not
	fever     
	1000


3. Train the model
	1. select the algorithm related to problem
	2. with the data we have to train the model


4 Test the model
	training(known) data (training score)
	with unseen(unknown) data (testing score)


student	
	5 questions for training

	testing
		testing with the same 5 question used in training (training score)
	testing score
		if conducted exam with unknown/unseen questions then it is resting score


improve model

performance 50% accuracy

we can improve the model to get more accuracy














Target/output/label
	The value you are predicting is the target  (Salary)


Features/Input
	The value we are taking as for predicting target  (Experience)






Salary
	10K,15K,12K,1L,1.5L
		









Predict the given email is spam or not?
	
	True/False
	Yes/No
	1/0

predict the given fruit is apple or mango or lemon ?
	
	apple/mango/lemon
	
	0 / 1/2
	










Tesing
	10 questions
		correct answers as 7


	performance = correct/total question
		= (7/10 ) * 100
		70%



Training the machine/model
Testing the machine / model
verifying the performance model






1. Anaconda software in that we use jupyter notebook


1. we will discuss shortcuts and syntax in jupyter notebook
2. working with simple csv file
